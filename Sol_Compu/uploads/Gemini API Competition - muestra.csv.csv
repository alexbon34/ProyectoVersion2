Davv AI,,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ONuSa48fb4,"Davv_AI is an AI-powered assistant designed to simplify tasks across various operating systems through intuitive voice and text interactions. It offers users, including those who are visually impaired, the ability to perform a wide range of tasks by simply speaking commands like ""open Google,"" ""search music on YouTube,"" or ""shutdown computer."" One of its standout features is the streaming record function, Once activated, you can start recording by simply saying ""Hi Google"", This feature allows users to record their sessions in real-time, providing immediate feedback and making interactions with the computer more accessible and manageable.
Davv_AI leverages the Gemini AI API to interpret natural language commands and convert them into executable Python code. The API processes the user's input, understanding the intent behind commands, and generates the corresponding code to execute the desired tasks. For more complex projects, such as developing a Snake game or a shopping website, Davv_AI uses the Gemini AI API to generate the necessary code and files, enabling users to focus on customization and refinement. The integration with the Gemini AI API is central to Davv_AI’s ability to seamlessly transform natural language into actionable code, enhancing productivity and accessibility for all users.","Web/Chrome, google speech recognition","Ali Debbache, abdou guerguer",Algeria,https://ai.google.dev/competition/projects/davv-ai
DDMD,,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BxzJcNyZNEw,"The DDMD project aims to provide an AI-powered solution for detecting digital drug music. The process begins with the collection of 3,176 non-copyrighted MP3 files, of which 1,676 are classified as digital drug music and 1,500 as not digital drug music.
These files are used to develop a Random Forest-based model that can classify audio files as either digital drug music or not. The model utilizes 34 features extracted from these audio files, covering both frequency and time-domain characteristics, and has achieved very encouraging results.
To make the results accessible and user-friendly, we developed a web application. This application leverages the trained Random Forest model to classify audio files through a simple and intuitive interface. The DDMD web application is built using Flask for the backend and HTML/CSS for the frontend. It utilizes the pre-trained Random Forest model to make predictions, accepting various audio file formats, converting non-MP3 files to MP3, and allowing input via a YouTube URL.
Additionally, to enhance classification accuracy, we are exploring ways to improve the DDMD application by fine-tuning the Gemini-1.5-flash model. We have proposed two approaches: first, we prepared a JSON dataset based on the Random Forest classifier results to fine-tune the Gemini-1.5-flash model. In the second approach, we are using the Gemini API and experimenting with different input formats, including CSV and JSON, to fine-tune this Gemini model.","Web/Chrome, Google Colab, Google Slides, Google Sppech-to-Text AI",,Algeria,https://ai.google.dev/competition/projects/ddmd

Discipleship Journey,"Be like Him, to Be with Him",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVSoSqyhEkA,"This console app prototype is specifically designed for believers of Jesus Christ to engage, plan and interact with the Bible. It offers 3 functions and what makes them distinct from popular apps are listed below:

1. Daily Word of the day – AI generates daily devotionals
Difference: Tailored to user's areas of growth and aspirations thus saving them time to search and find relevant devotionals themselves.
The response is fashioned to encourage, challenge and apply God’s Word with taking into account the user's specific goals and needs in their specific season or stage in life.

2. Bible reading planner – AI drafts a plan to complete reading Bible for a stipulated time duration
Difference: Plan fits with the user's schedule/calendar along with buffer time to catch up on missed readings.
The plan breakdown is to each day per week/month for ensuring the user to successfully accomplish their reading goal before dropping it altogether as an unattainable new year resolution plan.

3. Hear Jesus speak – AI acts as Jesus to answer questions
Difference: User’s question is answered by the expert of the scriptures.
The answer is ensured to quote the verse from Bible while providing its inference of its meaning. It greatly enables the user to view and think as Jesus does.

This app provides a fully functional kit for instilling Christian values daily. If each of us adds to their routine life, would not only break socioeconomic inequality barrier but would make this world a better place.",,Team Believers,Australia,https://ai.google.dev/competition/projects/discipleship-journey

Fetebird,Ultimate solution for University,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBcH8OSjkMk,"Fetebird revolutionizes assignment grading by harnessing the power of the Gemini API(gemini-1.5-flash-001) and a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture. It streamlines the evaluation process, providing educators with valuable insights into student understanding while maintaining flexibility and adaptability.
Core Functionality
Reference Answer Database - At its heart, Fetebird maintains a database of verified reference answers, each vectorized for efficient comparison. Initially, this database may contain only the teacher's solution, but it expands dynamically as more student submissions are reviewed and approved.
Gemini API Integration - The app leverages the Gemini API (gemini-1.5-flash-001) and the Langchain4j Java library to interact with a large language model. This enables Fetebird to perform complex evaluations and provide detailed feedback.
RAG Architecture - When a professor initiates an AI evaluation, Fetebird employs a RAG architecture. It retrieves relevant reference answers from the database and presents them to the Gemini model alongside the student's submission.
Prompt Engineering: Carefully crafted system and user prompts guide the model's evaluation. It considers the reference answers and the student's work to provide comprehensive feedback, highlighting strengths, weaknesses, and areas for improvement.",Web/Chrome,Fetebird,Australia,https://ai.google.dev/competition/projects/fetebird
Fortograph,Redact and unRedact data,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tSJ8SBf3ow,"The app uses Gemini Api to get the coordinates of the PIIs in an image and then redact them in a way where they can be unredacted. Using normal image viewer, the image will then appear with the PIIs redacted.

It also uses the Gemini Api to get the PIIs in an image and sends the coordinates to a web service to allows for redaction and unredaction of the data in the image.

It also uses the Gemini Api to test and see if the image contains data that has been redacted.

The sample image I used is taken from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_passport
